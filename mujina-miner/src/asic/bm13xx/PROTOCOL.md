# BM13xx Protocol Documentation

This document describes the serial communication protocol used by the BM13xx 
family of Bitcoin mining ASICs. Since manufacturer documentation is not publicly 
available, this represents our best understanding based on analyzing open-source 
implementations and reverse engineering efforts.

**Note on Multi-Chip Chains**: Our initial implementation focuses on single-chip 
configurations (e.g., Bitaxe). Details specific to multi-chip chains may be 
incomplete or uncertain. We will refine this documentation as development 
progresses and we gain experience with multi-chip systems.

## Overview

The BM13xx family (BM1362, BM1370, etc.) uses a frame-based 
serial protocol for communication between the host and mining ASICs. The 
protocol supports both command/response patterns and asynchronous nonce 
reporting.

### Chip Architecture

Different chips in the BM13xx family have varying core architectures:

- **BM1362**: Core count unknown (used in Antminer S19 J Pro)
  - Chip ID: `[0x13, 0x62]`
- **BM1370**: 80 main cores x 16 sub-cores = 1,280 total hashing units
  - Chip ID: `[0x13, 0x70]`

The core architecture affects how nonces are reported and job IDs are encoded.

## Frame Format

All frames follow this basic structure:
```
| Preamble | Type/Flags | Length | Payload | CRC |
```

### Command Frames (Host -> ASIC)
- **Preamble**: `0x55 0xAA` (2 bytes)
- **Type/Flags**: 1 byte encoding type, broadcast flag, and command
- **Length**: 1 byte total frame length
- **Payload**: Variable length data
- **CRC**: CRC5 for commands, CRC16 for jobs

### Response Frames (ASIC -> Host)
- **Preamble**: `0xAA 0x55` (2 bytes, reversed from commands)
- **Payload**: Response-specific data
- **CRC**: CRC5 in last byte (bits 0-4), with response type in bits 5-7
  - Confirmed: Response frames use CRC5 validation (verified in test cases)

## Byte Order (Endianness)

The protocol uses **little-endian** for data fields and **big-endian** for
CRC16 checksums.

### Data Fields (Little-Endian)

Multi-byte data fields transmit least significant byte first:
- **32-bit values**: nonce, nbits, ntime, version, register values
  - Example: `0x12345678` -> `[0x78, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12]`
- **16-bit values**: version field in responses
  - Example: `0x1234` -> `[0x34, 0x12]`

### Checksums (Big-Endian)

CRC16 checksums in job packets use network byte order (big-endian), transmitting
the high byte first. This follows common convention for integrity checks even in
otherwise little-endian protocols.
- **CRC16**: `0x6b18` -> `[0x6b, 0x18]`

### Special Cases

- **Hash values** (merkle_root, prev_block_hash): Convert from Bitcoin internal
  32-byte little-endian format by splitting into 8 4-byte words and reversing
  their order (word 0 with 7, 1 with 6, 2 with 5, 3 with 4).
- **chip_id in responses**: Treat as fixed byte sequence `[0x13, 0x70]` rather
  than an integer value
- **Single bytes**: No endianness applies (job_id, chip_address, etc.)

## Command Types

The Type/Flags byte (3rd byte in command frames) encodes multiple fields:

```
Bit 6: TYPE (1=register ops, 0=work)
Bit 4: BROADCAST (0=single chip, 1=all chips)
Bits 3-0: CMD value
Bits 7,5: Reserved/undefined in observed examples
```

**Implementation Note**: In our code, we use the field name `broadcast` for this
bit. Reference implementations may use different names (such as `all`), but they
all refer to the same protocol bit.

Common Type/Flags values:
- `0x40` = TYPE=1, BROADCAST=0, CMD=0 (set chip address)
- `0x41` = TYPE=1, BROADCAST=0, CMD=1 (write register to specific chip)
- `0x42` = TYPE=1, BROADCAST=0, CMD=2 (read register from specific chip)
- `0x51` = TYPE=1, BROADCAST=1, CMD=1 (write register to all chips)
- `0x52` = TYPE=1, BROADCAST=1, CMD=2 (read register from all chips - chip discovery)
- `0x53` = TYPE=1, BROADCAST=1, CMD=3 (chain inactive - prepare for addressing)
- `0x21` = TYPE=0, BROADCAST=0, CMD=1 (send work/job)

### Set Chip Address (CMD=0)
Assigns an address to a chip in the serial chain via daisy-chain forwarding.

**Request Format:**
```
| 0x55 0xAA | Type/Flags | Length | New_Addr | Reserved | CRC5 |
```
- Length: Always `0x05` (5 bytes excluding preamble)
- Type/Flags: `0x40` (NOT broadcast - uses daisy-chain forwarding)
- New_Addr: The address to assign (see "Address Interval" below)
- Reserved: Always `0x00` (no semantic meaning, possibly padding)
- Example: `55 AA 40 05 04 00 15` (assign address 0x04)

**Address Interval - Two Known Approaches:**

Different implementations use different address spacing strategies:

1. **Bitmain stock firmware**: Fixed increment of 2, always sends 128 commands
   - Addresses: 0x00, 0x02, 0x04, ... 0xFE
   - Observed in S19 J Pro and S21 Pro captures
   - Sends all 128 commands regardless of actual chip count

2. **esp-miner (Bitaxe)**: Dynamic interval based on chip count
   - `address_interval = 256 / chip_count`
   - Spreads addresses evenly across the 256-byte space
   - Examples: 1 chip → 0x00; 12 chips → 0, 21, 42...; 126 chips → 0, 2, 4...

It's unclear which approach is "correct" or if the chips care. Both work in
practice. mujina-miner uses the esp-miner approach (dynamic interval).

**How Daisy-Chain Addressing Works:**

After sending the ChainInactive command (CMD=3), all chips enter a special
addressing mode where they forward commands they don't respond to downstream:

1. Host sends ChainInactive (broadcast) - all chips enter addressing mode
2. Host sends SetChipAddress with new address (NOT broadcast)
3. First unaddressed chip in chain intercepts command and adopts that address
4. Now-addressed chip passes subsequent SetChipAddress commands downstream
5. Next unaddressed chip receives the command and adopts its address
6. Process repeats until all chips are addressed

This mechanism allows the host to sequentially address chips without knowing the
chain length beforehand. The command is NOT broadcast (BROADCAST bit = 0) because
it should only be processed by one chip at a time, but it doesn't target an
existing chip address - instead, it's intercepted by the first unaddressed chip
through forwarding.

### Chain Inactive (CMD=3)
Puts all chips into addressing mode, enabling the daisy-chain forwarding
mechanism used by SetChipAddress.

**Request Format:**
```
| 0x55 0xAA | Type/Flags | Length | Reserved | Reserved | CRC5 |
```
- Length: Always `0x05` (5 bytes excluding preamble)
- Type/Flags: `0x53` (broadcast to all chips)
- Both data bytes: Always `0x00 0x00`
- Example: `55 AA 53 05 00 00 03`

This command is broadcast to all chips before address assignment. In addressing
mode, chips that don't recognize a command (because it's not for them) will
forward it to the next chip in the chain. This enables the sequential addressing
mechanism described in SetChipAddress above.

### Read Register (CMD=2)
Reads a 4-byte register from the ASIC.

**Request Format:**
```
| 0x55 0xAA | Type/Flags | Length | Chip_Addr | Reg_Addr | CRC5 |
```
- Length: Always `0x05` (5 bytes excluding preamble)
- Type/Flags: `0x42` for specific chip, `0x52` for broadcast (chip discovery)
- Example: `55 AA 52 05 00 00 0A` (broadcast read register 0x00 - chip discovery)

### Write Register (CMD=1)
Writes a 4-byte value to a register.

**Request Format:**
```
| 0x55 0xAA | Type/Flags | Length | Chip_Addr | Reg_Addr | Data[4] | CRC5 |
```
- Length: Always `0x09` (9 bytes excluding preamble)
- Type/Flags: `0x51` for broadcast, `0x41` for specific chip
- Example: `55 AA 51 09 00 A4 90 00 FF FF 1C` (broadcast write 0xFF009090 to 
register 0xA4)

### Mining Job (TYPE=1, CMD=1)

BM13xx chips support two job formats, determined by the chip model and version 
rolling requirements:

1. **Full Format**: Used by BM1362/BM1370 - ASIC calculates midstates
2. **Midstate Format**: Used by BM1397 and others - Host pre-calculates midstates

#### Full Format (BM1362/BM1370)
The ASIC calculates SHA256 midstates internally from the provided block header 
components. This format is used by the chips mujina-miner supports.

**Request Format:**
```
| 0x55 0xAA | 0x21 | Length | Job_Data | CRC16 |
```
- **Preamble**: `0x55 0xAA` (2 bytes)
- **Type/Flags**: `0x21` = TYPE=0 (work), BROADCAST=0, CMD=1
- **Length**: `0x36` (54 decimal) - see "Length Byte Encoding" below
- **Job_Data**: 82 bytes of mining work (see below)
- **CRC16**: 16-bit CRC calculated over type/flags + length + job_data, stored in
big-endian format (MSB first)

**Length Byte Encoding:**

The length byte does NOT represent the actual byte count of the payload. Two
different encodings have been observed:

- `0x36` (54): Used by S21 Pro (BM1370), S19J Pro (BM1362), and bm13xx-rs
- `0x56` (86): Used by ESP-miner (Bitaxe)

Both values produce an 88-byte total frame with identical job data content. The
bm13xx-rs library computes the value as `frame_size - 32 - 2`, which equals
`22 + (1 * 32)`---the same formula used for job_midstate with 1 midstate.
This suggests the byte may encode a "midstate count equivalent" rather than an
actual length.

mujina-miner uses `0x36` to match industrial firmware captures.

**Job_Data Structure (82 bytes):**
```
| job_header | num_midstates | starting_nonce[4] | nbits[4] | ntime[4] |
merkle_root[32] | prev_block_hash[32] | version[4] |
```
- **job_header** (1 byte): Container for job identification
  - Bits 6-3: 4-bit job_id field (values 0-15)
  - Bits 7, 2-0: Unused by chip (should be zero)
  - The chip extracts bits 6-3 as the job identifier
- **num_midstates** (1 byte): Number of midstates (always 0x01 for BM1370)
  - ESP-miner hardcodes this to 0x01 regardless of version rolling
  - Version rolling is actually controlled by register 0xA4 (VERSION_MASK)
  - This field may be vestigial for chips using full format
- **starting_nonce** (4 bytes): Starting nonce value (always 0x00000000)
- **nbits** (4 bytes): Encoded difficulty target (little-endian)
  - Example: 0x170E3AB4 -> transmitted as [0xB4, 0x3A, 0x0E, 0x17]
- **ntime** (4 bytes): Block timestamp (little-endian)
  - Unix timestamp
- **merkle_root** (32 bytes): Root of transaction merkle tree
  - Convert from Bitcoin internal 32-byte little-endian format by splitting
    into 8 4-byte words and reversing their order (word 0 with 7, 1 with 6, 2
    with 5, 3 with 4)
- **prev_block_hash** (32 bytes): Hash of previous block
  - Convert from Bitcoin internal 32-byte little-endian format by splitting
    into 8 4-byte words and reversing their order (word 0 with 7, 1 with 6, 2
    with 5, 3 with 4)
- **version** (4 bytes): Block version (little-endian)
  - Example: 0x20000000 -> transmitted as [0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x20]
  - Lower bits may be modified if version rolling enabled

**Example Job Packet:**
```
55 AA 21 36                              # Preamble + Type + Length
18                                       # job_header: bits[6:3]=0b0011 (job_id field=3)
01                                       # num_midstates = 1
00 00 00 00                              # starting_nonce
B4 3A 0E 17                              # nbits
5C 8B 67 67                              # ntime
[32 bytes merkle_root]                   # merkle_root
[32 bytes prev_block_hash]               # prev_block_hash  
00 00 00 20                              # version
XX XX                                    # CRC16
```
Total: 88 bytes (2 preamble + 1 type + 1 length + 82 job_data + 2 CRC16)

#### Midstate Format (Not Used by mujina-miner)

Some BM13xx chips (like BM1397) require the host to pre-calculate SHA256 
midstates for version rolling. In this format:
- The host calculates different midstates for each version variation
- Job packet includes 1-4 pre-calculated midstates (32 bytes each)
- Enables more efficient version rolling on the ASIC
- Total packet size varies based on number of midstates

Since BM1362/BM1370 calculate midstates internally, mujina-miner uses 
the full format exclusively. Version rolling is controlled by register 0xA4 
(VERSION_MASK), not by the `num_midstates` field.

## Response Types

### Read Register Response (TYPE=0)
**Format (11 bytes total):**
```
| 0xAA 0x55 | Register_Value[4] | Chip_Addr | Reg_Addr | Unknown[2] | CRC5+Type |
```

All register read responses from the BM13xx chips we support use this fixed 11-byte 
format, regardless of chip model or configuration settings.

- **Register_Value**: 4-byte value read from the register
- **Chip_Addr**: Address of the responding chip
- **Reg_Addr**: Address of the register that was read
- **Unknown**: 2 bytes of unknown purpose
- **CRC5+Type**: Last byte with CRC5 in bits 0-4 and response type (0) in bits 5-7

Example response for reading register 0x00 (CHIP_ID):
- Command: `55 AA 52 05 00 00 0A`
- Response: `AA 55 13 70 00 00 00 00 00 00 10`
  - Register_Value: `13 70 00 00` (contains BM1370 chip ID in first 2 bytes)
  - Chip_Addr: `00`
  - Reg_Addr: `00`
  - Unknown: `00 00`
  - CRC5+Type: `10`

Note: Only register 0x00 read has been captured. The purpose of the 2 unknown 
bytes is not documented.

### Nonce Response (TYPE=4)

**Format (11 bytes total):**
```
| 0xAA 0x55 | Nonce[4] | Midstate_Num | Result_Header | Version[2] | CRC5+Type |
```

**Response Length Note:**
The BM13xx family chips we support (BM1362, BM1366, BM1368, BM1370) all use 11-byte 
nonce responses that include a 2-byte version field. This is confirmed by all captured 
serial data. Documentation suggests the BM1397 (also in the BM13xx family) uses 9-byte 
responses without the version field, but we choose not to support the BM1397 in this 
implementation.

**Purpose of Core and Job ID Encoding:**
The encoding allows ASICs to:
- Match nonces back to their original work assignments
- Identify which specific core found a valid nonce (main core + sub-core)
- Support efficient work distribution across all cores

**Field Encoding by Chip Type:**

#### BM1370 (80 cores x 16 sub-cores = 1,280 units):
- **Nonce**: 32-bit nonce value (little-endian)
  - Bits 31-25: Main core ID (7 bits, values 0-79)
  - Bits 24-0: Actual nonce value
- **Midstate_Num**: Chip/core identifier (uncertain - may encode chip ID in 
multi-chip chains)
- **Result_Header**: 8-bit field containing:
  - Bits 7-4: 4-bit job_id field (0-15)
  - Bits 3-0: 4-bit subcore_id (0-15)
- **Version**: 16-bit version bits (little-endian)
  - When version rolling enabled: Contains rolled bits to be shifted left 13
positions

**Job ID Bitfield Mapping:**
The 4-bit job_id field (0-15) appears at different bit positions in sent jobs
vs. returned nonces:
- **Sent**: job_header[6:3] (encode: `job_header = job_id << 3`)
- **Returned**: result_header[7:4] (extract: `job_id = result_header >> 4`)

**Implementation Note:**
mujina-miner treats job_id as a true 4-bit field (0-15) throughout the
codebase. Reference implementations (esp-miner, emberone-miner) take a
different approach: they use full u8 values (24, 48, 72...), send them
directly, and reconstruct them from responses using `(result_header & 0xf0) >>
1`. Both approaches work, but treating job_id as 4-bit aligns more naturally
with how the chip actually operates.

Example BM1370 response: `AA 55 18 00 A6 40 02 99 22 F9 91`
- Nonce: 0x40A60018 -> Main core 32, nonce value 0x00A60018
- Result_Header: 0x99 -> job_id=9 (bits 7-4), subcore_id=9 (bits 3-0)
- Version: 0xF922 -> Version bits 0x045F2000 (after shifting)


#### BM1362:

The BM1362 uses the same 11-byte nonce response format as BM1370, but the
result_header byte encodes fields differently.

**Result_Header field layout:**

| Chip | job_id bits | Extraction |
|------|-------------|------------|
| BM1370 | 7-4 | `(result_header >> 4) & 0x0f` |
| BM1362 | 6-3 | `(result_header >> 3) & 0x0f` |

Both chips receive job_id in bits 6-3 of the job_header when a job is sent.
The BM1370 shifts this value up by 1 bit when returning it in the nonce
response; the BM1362 returns it in the same bit position.

**Example:** If job_id=7 is sent (job_header=`0x38`, bits 6-3 = 0111):
- BM1370 returns result_header with bits 7-4 = 0111 (e.g., `0x7x`)
- BM1362 returns result_header with bits 6-3 = 0111 (e.g., `0x3x`)

Applying the wrong extraction formula yields the wrong job_id:
- result_header `0x3b` with BM1370 formula: `(0x3b >> 4) & 0x0f = 3`
- result_header `0x3b` with BM1362 formula: `(0x3b >> 3) & 0x0f = 7`

**Source:** emberone-miner reference implementation
(`piaxe/bm1362.py:422-423`):
```python
def get_job_id_from_result(self, job_id):
    return job_id & 0xf8  # Masks to bits 7-3
```

**Other fields:**
- Midstate_Num may encode chip ID in multi-chip configurations
- Subcore_id appears to occupy bits 2-0 (3 bits)

Example response: `AA 55 6D B8 8E E1 01 04 03 54 94`


### Special Response Types

Some nonce responses carry special meanings:

#### Temperature Responses
- Identified by specific job_id values (e.g., 0xB4)
- Nonce field encodes temperature data instead of mining result
- Pattern: `nonce & 0x0000FFFF == 0x00000080`
- Temperature value in upper bytes of nonce field

#### Zero Nonces
- Nonce value 0x00000000 can be valid for non-mining responses
- Always check job_id to determine response type

## Initialization Sequence

### Single-Chip Initialization (e.g., Bitaxe)

1. **Chip Detection**
   - Write 0xFFFF0090 to register 0xA4 (enable and set version mask)
   - Read register 0x00 to get chip_id
   - Verify chip type

2. **Basic Configuration**
   - Write register 0xA8 with 0x00070000

7. **Final Configuration**
   - Set NONCE_RANGE (0x10) based on chip count
   - Configure remaining registers
   - Begin frequency ramping

## Domain Management in Multi-Chip Chains

Large chip chains are divided into voltage domains. While domains primarily
exist for power management (each domain has its own voltage regulator), they
also require special serial bus configuration for signal integrity and
contention avoidance.

### Physical Architecture

**Voltage Domains:**
- Each domain contains a group of chips (typically 5 chips on S21 Pro)
- Chips within a domain share a local voltage regulator (LDO)
- Domain count varies: S21 Pro has 13 domains (65 chips / 5 per domain)

**Serial Bus:**
- All chips share a single serial daisy-chain regardless of voltage domains
- CI (Command In) flows from host toward end of chain
- RO (Response Out) flows from end of chain back to host
- BI/BO (Busy In/Out) is a separate contention-avoidance signal chain

### Contention Avoidance: The BI/BO Mechanism

When multiple chips receive a broadcast command (e.g., "read ChipId"), they all
want to respond. The BI (Busy Input) and BO (Busy Output) pins prevent response
collisions:

```
BI/BO signal chain (flows toward host):

Host <─── Chip 0 <─── Chip 1 <─── Chip 2 <─── ... <─── Chip 64
          BI←BO       BI←BO       BI←BO               BO (unused)
```

**Protocol when a chip wants to respond:**
1. Check BI pin---if HIGH, another chip is transmitting; wait for LOW
2. Assert BO (goes HIGH) to signal "I'm about to transmit"
3. Wait GAP_CNT clock cycles for BO to propagate to chips behind (toward host)
4. Begin transmitting response on RO
5. De-assert BO when transmission complete

**Why GAP_CNT is necessary:**
The BO signal takes time to propagate through the chain. Without waiting, a chip
could start transmitting before chips closer to the host see the busy signal:

```
Without GAP_CNT wait (race condition):

Chip 64: [Assert BO]──[Start TX immediately]───────────────────>
                │
BO propagation: ═══════════════════════════════════════════════>
                      (takes time to reach Chip 0)
                │
Chip 0:         [BI still LOW]──[Starts TX!]──[BI finally HIGH]
                                │
                                └── COLLISION! Started before seeing BI
```

**GAP_CNT ensures BO propagates before TX begins:**

```
With GAP_CNT wait:

Chip 64: [Assert BO]──[Wait GAP_CNT]──────────[Start TX]───────>
                │
BO propagation: ══════════════════════════════>
                                              │
Chip 0:         [BI goes HIGH]────────────────[Waits, sees BI]──>
                                              │
                                              └── No collision
```

### The GAP_CNT Formula

GAP_CNT is configured via the UART Relay register (0x2C) on domain boundary
chips. The value depends on how many chips are "behind" (toward host) that need
to see the BO signal before transmission begins:

```
GAP_CNT = (chips_per_domain × domains_behind) + base_overhead
        = domain_asic_cnt × (chain_domain_cnt - domain_index) + 14
```

Where:
- `domain_index` = 0 for the domain nearest the host
- `chain_domain_cnt` = total number of domains
- `domain_asic_cnt` = chips per domain
- `14` = base overhead (safety margin, internal chip delays)

**Example: S21 Pro (65 chips, 13 domains of 5 chips each)**

| Domain | Position | Chips Behind | GAP_CNT | Calculation |
|--------|----------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| 0 | Near host | 60 | 79 (0x4F) | 5 × (13-0) + 14 |
| 6 | Middle | 30 | 49 (0x31) | 5 × (13-6) + 14 |
| 12 | Far end | 0 | 19 (0x13) | 5 × (13-12) + 14 |

Chips at the far end of the chain have fewer chips behind them, so they need
less time for their BO signal to propagate---hence smaller GAP_CNT values.

### Domain-Specific Registers

Configuration is applied only to domain boundary chips (first and last chip of
each domain). Middle-of-domain chips use default settings.

**IO Driver Strength (0x58):**
Controls output driver strength for various signals. Domain-end chips get
stronger CLKO (clock out) drivers for signal integrity across boundaries.

- All chips (broadcast): `0x00011111`
- Domain-end chips: `0x0001F111` (CLKO field = 0xF instead of 0x1)

Note: bm13xx-rs library uses CLKO=3 (`0x00013111`), but actual S21 Pro captures
show CLKO=15 (`0x0001F111`). The difference may be product-specific.

**UART Relay (0x2C):**
Configured on first and last chip of each domain. Controls signal regeneration
and the GAP_CNT timing for contention avoidance.

Register fields:
- Bits 31-16: GAP_CNT (16-bit delay value)
- Bit 1: RO_REL_EN (Response Out relay enable)
- Bit 0: CO_REL_EN (Command Out relay enable)

Domain boundary chips enable both relay bits (`0x____0003`).

### Example: S21 Pro Domain Configuration

```
Domain 12 (far from host): Chips 0x78-0x80
  - First chip 0x78: UART Relay = 0x00130003 (GAP_CNT=19)
  - Last chip 0x80:  UART Relay = 0x00130003, IO Driver = 0x0001F111

Domain 6 (middle): Chips 0x3C-0x44
  - First chip 0x3C: UART Relay = 0x00310003 (GAP_CNT=49)
  - Last chip 0x44:  UART Relay = 0x00310003, IO Driver = 0x0001F111

Domain 0 (near host): Chips 0x00-0x08
  - First chip 0x00: UART Relay = 0x004F0003 (GAP_CNT=79)
  - Last chip 0x08:  UART Relay = 0x004F0003, IO Driver = 0x0001F111
```

### Chip Differences: BM1370 vs BM1362

**BM1370 (S21 Pro, 65 chips):**
- Full domain configuration with IO driver and UART relay settings
- GAP_CNT formula applies as documented above
- Required for 3 Mbaud operation

**BM1362 (S19 J Pro, 126 chips):**
- Simpler configuration: no domain-specific IO driver or UART relay
- All chips receive identical register configuration
- May have internal auto-compensation, or lower baud rate reduces need

## Key Implementation Details

### Job Distribution Across Multiple Chips

In multi-chip mining systems, job distribution works as follows:

#### Chip Addressing
- Each chip in a chain is assigned a unique 8-bit address during initialization
- Addresses are typically spaced evenly (e.g., 0, 4, 8, 12... for a 64-chip 
chain)
- The address determines which portion of the nonce space each chip searches

#### Job Broadcasting
- **The same job is sent to ALL chips in the chain**
- Single broadcast command propagates through the entire chain
- Each chip automatically works on a different portion of the nonce space

#### Nonce Space Partitioning
The 32-bit nonce space (4.3 billion values) is automatically divided:

1. **Between Chips**: Based on chip address and NONCE_RANGE register
   - Chip address influences which nonces are searched
   - NONCE_RANGE register (0x10) further controls distribution
   - No explicit range assignment needed from software

2. **Between Cores**: Within each chip
   - Core ID encoded in upper nonce bits (typically bits 24-31)
   - Each core searches ~33.5 million nonces (4.3B / 128 cores)

3. **Example**: BM1370 with 80 cores x 16 sub-cores
   - Bits 31-25: Main core ID (80 cores)
   - Bits 24-0: Actual nonce value searched
   - Total: 1,280 parallel searches per chip

#### NONCE_RANGE Register Configuration

The NONCE_RANGE register (0x10) uses empirically-determined values to optimize 
nonce distribution. See discussion at: https://github.com/bitaxeorg/ESP-Miner/pull/167

**Known Values (4-byte little-endian):**
- 1 chip: `0x00001EB5` (Bitaxe single BM1370)
- 65 chips: `0x00001EB5` (S21 Pro - same as single chip!)
- 77 chips: `0x0000115A` (S19k Pro - from ESP-miner)
- 110 chips: `0x0000141C` (S19XP Stock - from ESP-miner)
- 110 chips: `0x00001446` (S19XP Luxos - from ESP-miner)
- 126 chips: `0x00001381` (S19 J Pro BM1362)
- Full range: `0x000F0000` (experimental, searches full 32-bit space?)

**How It Likely Works:**
While the exact mechanism is undocumented, analysis suggests:
- The value may define a stride/increment for nonce searching
- Combined with chip address to ensure non-overlapping ranges
- Smaller values for more chips ensure better coverage
- Values appear carefully chosen to minimize gaps in search space

**Example Theory:**
With register value 0x00001EB5 (7,861 decimal):
- Chip might test nonces at intervals of 7,861
- Starting offset based on chip address
- Ensures even distribution without collision

Note: The ESP-miner source notes this register is "still a bit of a mystery" 
and values are determined through empirical testing rather than documentation.
Multi-chip configurations may require different values than those listed.

#### Starting Nonce Field
- Always set to 0x00000000 in practice
- Hardware automatically offsets based on chip/core addressing
- Software doesn't need to manually partition the nonce space

#### Practical Example: 4-Chip Chain
Consider a 4-chip BM1370 chain mining a block:
1. **Job sent**: Same job broadcast to all 4 chips
2. **Chip addresses**: 0x00, 0x40, 0x80, 0xC0 (64 apart)
3. **Nonce space division**:
   - Chip 0: Searches nonces where certain bits = 0x00
   - Chip 1: Searches nonces where certain bits = 0x40
   - Chip 2: Searches nonces where certain bits = 0x80
   - Chip 3: Searches nonces where certain bits = 0xC0
4. **Total parallel operations**: 4 chips x 1,280 cores = 5,120 simultaneous
searches

#### Multiple Hash Board Distribution
When a mining system has multiple hash boards, the software MUST prevent 
duplicate work:

1. **Time-Based Work Distribution** (most common):
   - Each board receives work with a different `ntime` offset
   - Board 0: ntime + 0
   - Board 1: ntime + 1
   - Board 2: ntime + 2
   - This ensures each board searches a unique block variation

2. **Work Registry**:
   - Software maintains a registry tracking which work is on which board
   - Each work assignment has a unique ID
   - Nonce responses are matched back to the correct work/board

3. **Example**: Antminer S19 with 3 hash boards
   - Board 0: Works on block with ntime=X
   - Board 1: Works on block with ntime=X+1
   - Board 2: Works on block with ntime=X+2
   - Total: 3 boards x 76 chips x ~100 cores = ~23,000 parallel searches
   - Each searching a DIFFERENT block variation

4. **No Wasted Work**:
   - Every hash calculation is unique across all boards
   - Software actively manages work distribution
   - Hardware (chips/cores) handle nonce space division within each board

### Job ID Management

#### Purpose of Job IDs
Job IDs are critical for mining operation even though work is broadcast to all
chips.

1. **Asynchronous Nonce Returns**: Chips find and return nonces at 
unpredictable times
2. **Pipeline Overlap**: Multiple jobs can be "in flight" simultaneously:
   - Commands propagate serially through chip chains (milliseconds for 64+ 
chips)
   - Cores may still be processing old jobs when new ones arrive
   - Typically 2-3 jobs overlap during normal operation
3. **Work Identification**: When a nonce arrives, the job ID identifies which 
block template it belongs to
4. **Critical for Block Changes**: When a new block is found on the network:
   - Old work becomes invalid immediately
   - Nonces for old jobs must be discarded

#### Example Timeline
```
Time 0ms:    Send Job with job_id=0 (mining block height 850,000)
Time 50ms:   Send Job with job_id=1 (same block, updated transactions)
Time 90ms:   NEW BLOCK! Send Job with job_id=2 (mining block height 850,001)
Time 95ms:   Receive nonce with job_id=0 -> Discard (old block)
Time 100ms:  Receive nonce with job_id=2 -> Valid for current block
```

### CRC Calculation
- **CRC5**: Used for command/response frames
  - Polynomial: 0x05
  - Init: 0x1F
  - Calculated over all bytes after preamble
  - Transmitted as single byte
- **CRC16**: Used for job packets only
  - Polynomial: 0x1021 (CRC-16-CCITT-FALSE)
  - Init: 0xFFFF
  - Calculated over all bytes after preamble, before CRC
  - Transmitted in big-endian byte order (see Byte Order section above)

### Version Rolling and Midstates

Version rolling allows ASICs to expand their search space beyond the 32-bit 
nonce range by modifying the block version field.

#### How Version Rolling Works

1. **Search Order**: The ASIC searches in this sequence:
   - First: All nonces in the chip's range, using current version
   - Then: Increment version and search all nonces again
   - Continues until all allowed version values are exhausted

2. **Version Rolling Control**:
   - Version rolling is enabled via register 0xA4 (VERSION_MASK)
   - The chip internally modifies version bits as allowed by the mask
   - For BM1370, ESP-miner always sets `num_midstates = 1`
   - AsicBoost optimization happens internally in the chip

3. **Version Mask Configuration**:
   - Set via register 0xA4 (e.g., 0x1FFFE000 enables bits 13-28)
   - ASICs can only modify bits enabled in the mask
   - The rolled bits are returned in the nonce response
   - Reconstructed version: `original_version | (response.version << 13)`

4. **Search Space Multiplication**:
   - Without version rolling: 2^32 hashes per job
   - With 16-bit version rolling: 2^32 x 2^16 = 2^48 hashes per job
   - At 1 TH/s, exhausting 2^48 hashes would take ~78 hours

5. **Job Exhaustion**:
   - No explicit "work complete" signal from the ASIC
   - Mining software must send new jobs before exhaustion

#### Version Rolling in Multi-Chip Chains

In a multi-chip chain, version rolling works seamlessly with automatic nonce 
space partitioning:

1. **Each Chip's Search Pattern**:
   - Chip searches its assigned nonce range (based on chip address)
   - After exhausting its nonce range, increments version
   - Searches the same nonce range again with new version
   - The chip address ensures no overlap between chips

3. **No Duplication**:
   - Chip address bits embedded in nonce ensure unique ranges
   - Version rolling multiplies each chip's search space equally
   - Total search space: (nonces per chip) x (chips) x (version values)
   - Example: 1B nonces x 4 chips x 65K versions = 2^50 unique hashes

4. **Timing Considerations**:
   - All chips roll versions at different times
   - Faster chips may reach version 2 while others still on version 1
   - This is fine---no coordination needed between chips
   - Each chip's nonce+version combination remains unique
