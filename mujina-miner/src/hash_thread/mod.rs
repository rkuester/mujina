//! HashThread abstraction for schedulable mining workers.
//!
//! A HashThread represents a schedulable group of hashing engines that work
//! together to execute mining tasks. The scheduler assigns work to HashThreads
//! without needing to know about the underlying hardware topology (single chip,
//! chip chain, engine groups, etc.).
//!
//! # Share Processing
//!
//! HashThreads forward ALL shares from chips to the scheduler:
//!
//! 1. Chips are configured with low difficulty targets (e.g., diff 100-1000)
//!    for frequent health signals
//! 2. Thread computes hash for every chip share (required to determine
//!    what difficulty it meets)
//! 3. Thread forwards all shares via ShareFound events (since hash is already
//!    computed, filtering is trivial)
//! 4. Scheduler performs final filtering against job target
//!
//! This design keeps thread implementation simple, provides scheduler with
//! ground truth for per-thread hashrate, and centralizes filtering logic.
//! Message volume is manageable: ~1-2 shares/sec per chip at typical targets.
